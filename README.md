# Q-learning-DuskDrive-OpenAI-Universe


Very easy to set up...

Dependencies: 

Set up tesorflow or tensorflow-gpu.<br>
Of course, OpenAI Universe.<br>
Other python dependencies:<br>
pip install numpy<br>
pip install Pillow<br>
pip install scipy

This attempt was inspired from a tutorial by Hvass-Labs who's author is Magnus Erik Hvass Pedersen.

This is a very plain implementation with just the minimum of code required to run the Q-Learning Algorithm.
